<h1>Research Experiences</h1>


<h2> Jul 2023 – Present <i> Humanoid Pianist </i> </h2>      

<p> <b> Advisor: Pro.</b> Huazhe XU, Assistant Professor at Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences, Tsinghua University </p>
<p>A robot is trained by manifold and RL to play the piano. </p>
<p>I expect to learn the research method in this project. </p>

<h2> Apr 2023 – Jun 2023 <i> Game Theoretic Model </i> </h2>

<p> A project of Game Theory course. </p>
<p> <b> Leading Instructor: Pro. </b> Zhixuan FANG, Assistant Professor at Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences, Tsinghua University </p>
<p> Extended the algorithm in the paper <i> Deployed armor protection: the application of a game theoretic model for security at the Los Angeles international airport</i> </p>
<p> The paper uses a Bayesian Stackelberg game model with a single type of leader and multiple types of followers, and reduced it to an MILP (mixed-integer linear programming) to solve it. In this project, we extended the algorithm to solve Bayesian Stackelberg games with multiple types of leaders and followers, and examined the performance. </p>
<p> <b>Result:</b> Wrote a paper Extension of the Game Theoretic Model for Security at the International Airport</p>

<h2> Dec 2019 – Jun 2020 <i> Fractional Cascading Algorithm </i> </h2>
<p> An IOI National Training Team Homework. </p>
<p> Examined the use of Fractional cascading in a Classic Partition Problem. </p>

<p>Result:  Published a paper <i> On the Optimization of a Classic Partition Problem Using Fractional Cascading Algorithm </i> in <i> IOI2020 National Training Team Paper Collection </i>. Became the IOI National Team member by defend of the paper and 6 contests. </p>
